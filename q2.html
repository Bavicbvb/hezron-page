                </div>
    
                <p>This varies a lot, depending on the size of the site you need. A simple one-page information site can be done in a day. A 40-page eCommerce site may take a month or longer.</p>

                <p>Selecting the model that is right for your app will depend on a variety of factors, but you need to establish your monetization strategy before you launch your product. Business objectives will dictate the approach your product employs. At the base level, you need to consider what your app does. Some monetization models will lend themselves to particular types of apps. For example, the subscription model works best for services like music and video streaming, news and entertainment and other apps focused heavily on content. In-app purchases, on the other hand, are lucrative for free-to-play games and apps centered around products like shopping and Retail apps.</p>
